## Free Software does not mean free-of-charge services

Our software is like a free spirit - it's all about the freedom to choose, not about being free of cost. Using our software doesn't mean we're tied at the hip or that you get VIP treatment. It's a no-strings-attached kind of deal. You're free to use it, and we're here to share it. Fair and square.

Kindly note that the word “Free” in the Free and Open Source Software (FOSS) designation of the software refers to freedom of choice, not lack of cost, as explained [by the Free Software Foundation itself](https://www.gnu.org/philosophy/selling.en.html).  

Using our free of charge, FOSS software does not create any kind of business or other relationship between us, does not grant you any privileges and does not mean that we are obliged to offer any service level whatsoever free of charge.

You are free to choose whether you want to use our FOSS software and the resources we make available to you free of charge.  You are, however, not entitled to any privileges or special treatment just by merit of using our software.
